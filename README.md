# HextrixAI - Advanced AI System with OS Integration

HextrixAI is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence system that combines a powerful multimodal AI assistant with low-level OS integration capabilities. This project aims to create a comprehensive AI ecosystem that can interact with users through multiple modalities while leveraging deep system integration.

## Current Development Status (v0.3.8-dev)

The project is currently in active development with a significantly improved user interface and stability:
- âœ… Fully functional command-line shell with reliable keyboard input
- âœ… Comprehensive Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) with device drivers
- âœ… Memory protection with software validation
- âœ… Hierarchical file system with full command interface
- âœ… Cooperative multitasking with priority-based scheduling
- âœ… Command history and tab completion
- âœ… Enhanced printf functionality with proper text formatting

## Core Features

### Command Line Shell
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Reliable text-based interface with proper keyboard mapping
- **Command Processing**: Support for a wide range of system commands
- **History & Completion**: Command history navigation and tab completion
- **Formatted Output**: Proper text formatting for readable output

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- **Device Abstraction**: Uniform interface for hardware access
- **Polling-Based Drivers**: Stable device interaction without interrupts
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy addition of new device drivers
- **Hardware Independence**: OS code isolated from hardware details

### Process Management
- **Process Control**: Complete PCB-based process management with state tracking
- **Priority Scheduling**: Priority-based process scheduling with aging
- **Memory Protection**: Region-based memory protection with access controls
- **Task Management**: Process creation, termination, and priority adjustment

### File System
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Directory structure with navigation (cd, pwd)
- **File Operations**: File creation, reading, writing, and deletion
- **Path Handling**: Support for absolute and relative paths
- **Metadata**: File permissions and attribute management

### Memory Management
- **Protection Mechanisms**: Software-based memory protection
- **Region Control**: Memory region management for access control
- **Paging System**: Page-level protection through paging
- **Permission Flags**: Read/write/execute permission enforcement
