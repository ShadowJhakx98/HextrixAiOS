# HextrixAI - Comprehensive Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development trajectory for the HextrixAI project, combining operating system development with advanced AI integration. The plan spans 7 days of intensive development, resulting in a complete, AI-powered operating system.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1) âœ…
*Status: Completed (4-5 hours)*

### Core OS Fundamentals
- âœ… Kernel boot process with GRUB multiboot support
- âœ… Basic memory management with kmalloc/kfree
- âœ… Terminal interface with text output
- âœ… Polling-based keyboard input
- âœ… Simple hierarchical file system with directories
- âœ… Command-line shell with basic commands
- âœ… Task scheduler with simple multitasking

## Phase 2: Core Systems (Day 2)
*Duration: 14-17 hours*

### Initial Improvements (First 2-3 hours)

  - âœ… Process CPU usage tracking
  - âœ… Parent-child process relationships
- âœ… Basic memory protection mechanisms
  - âœ… Memory region management for access control
  - âœ… Page-level protection through paging
  - âœ… Read/write/execute permission flags

### System I/O
- ðŸŸ¡ Transition from polling to interrupt-driven I/O (in progress)
- ðŸŸ¡ IRQ management (in progress)
- ðŸ”² Device abstraction layer
- ðŸ”² System call interface

### File System Enhancements
- âœ… Block allocation for larger files
- âœ… File caching for improved performance
- âœ… File permissions enforcement
- âœ… Metadata support

### Shell Improvements
- âœ… Command history functionality
- âœ… Enhanced command parsing
- ðŸ”² Tab completion

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix Interrupt System (Priority)**
   - Implement proper PIC initialization
   - Set up basic IDT with essential handlers (timer, keyboard)
   - Enable CPU interrupts (STI instruction)
   - Test with timer interrupt first

2. **Enable Preemptive Multitasking**
   - Update scheduler to use timer interrupts
   - Implement context switching in timer interrupt handler
   - Test with multiple processes

3. **Enhance Memory Protection**
   - Integrate memory protection with interrupt system
   - Implement proper page fault handling
   - Set up full virtual memory management

4. **Improve System Stability**
   - Add error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement proper fault isolation
   - Add diagnostic logging
